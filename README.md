My third web app written using Angular 14. Inspired by GeoGuessr, but it is simpler, client only version, which means that it doesn't store any data and has less features. The main game generates coordinates from around the world, but you can play on other preset maps or create your own map (keep in mind that if you refresh page that map will be lost). In game creation process you can set time limit or add some restriction like: no zooming, no moving, no camera rotation. After you create a game, randomly generated string is used as seed to fetch coordinates from google maps. This seed is accessable from url and can be used to play on the same coordinates with friends even though you will have no connection. In the url are also saved the same settings you set in creation process, so you can easly play on the same rules.
